- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

I'm not gonna lie, this project was the most challenging thus far. I have a lot of skills that I got to brush up on. Specifically, animations, mainly just getting more comfortable with using them. And how to properly implement them into future projects. Also, I really need to get better at the CSS line for, "position" and how to utilize them properly. I'll definitely do more research on these two, to bettter understand them. That being said, though it was challenging, I had a lot of fun making this project. And can't wait to get more comfortable with my current skills, and learning new ones! I would like to have an idea to better improve this project, but I feel like it challenged me enough thus far. Maybe once I get better, I'll be able to better improve it!

##About this project:
With this project, we got more in depth with BEM and adding more things to our page such as fonts, videos, forms and more transitions. You can see a lot of it goes into action!
